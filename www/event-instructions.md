## Instructions: Event

### Match Schedule

The match schedule is the red and blue table found to the right of the links, or at the bottom of the page on small screens. Click on a match or team number to get links relevant for that team and match:

 - Match prediction
 - Match planning
 - Scouting
 - Stats

The text colors in the match schedule provide extra information:

 - White text: that team has not been scouted for that match
 - Green text: scouting data has already been uploaded for that team and match
 - Text with a red, wavy strikethrough: there's a problem with the scouting for that team and match, such as duplicate data

If team-specific features have been enabled for this instance of viperscout, additional color-coding is available:
 - Green underline: your team
 - Orange underline: data needed for your next match

### Scouting

The scouting section provides links to collecting different types of data about teams.

Once a scouting page is open, the tablet, phone, or laptop can be unplugged from the scouting briefcase. Plug back in when you need to upload data or if the page is reloaded.

You must be logged in as "scouter" or "admin" to be able to upload scouting data.

#### Types of Scouting

Match scouting allows you to collect data about each team as they compete.

Bot photo scouting allows you to take and upload pictures of each robot from different angles (usually taken in the pits).

Pit scouting invovles interviewing each team and collecting data about their robot's abilities and specs.

#### Pit and Photo Scouting Squads

Use squads to divide up pit and bot photo scouting work. Clicking the up and down arrows will increase or decrease the number of teams that will be scouting. Each scouting squad will be assigned a fair share of the total number of teams. Click each squad's numbered button on a different device to open the pit and bot photo scouting for the assigned teams in separate browser tabs.

### Match and Alliance Planning

Viperscout provides an number of ways to use scouting data.

"Stats for alliance selection" provides graphs of each team's performance. The device can be unplugged from the scouting briefcase once the page is opened and taken to the field with the team representative.

Match prediction estimates how many points each team will score in a match based on their performance in other matches.

The match planner shows team stats beside an editable "whiteboard" to allow you to use scouting data to inform match strategy. Like the alliance selection stats, the device can be unplugged and taken anywhere once the page is open.

### Edit Event

You must be logged in as "admin" to be able save edited event or CSV data.

### CSV Data

All data is stored in comma separated value (CSV) format. Downloaded data can be imported into spreadsheets (Excel, Open Office, or Google Sheets).

Be careful editing CSV files directly. There is data validation on changed data. The scouting app may not work correctly if data is not in the expected format.
